GSM-NETWORK-TRACKER v0.01

-What ist this?
The intention behind GSM-NETWORK-TRACKER is to create a tool which will be capable of estimating the position of GSM and UMTS basestations around you and display them on a map. 

This tool will be devided in two parts: The actual tracker, which is an Android application (currently running on 2.3.3) to collect the data and a python script which does visualization.

Note: The project is in a pretty early stage and will therefore take some time to grow. 

-Changelog:
ver. 0.02:
Initial release of the Android App. All essential features included. Still buggy, GUI crappy
