GSM-NETWORK-TRACKER v0.01

-What ist this?

Currently I'm working on a little tool which is capable of tracking location data of GSM and UMTS cells. 

When I'm done with my work one will be able to create a map which shows all
estimated locations of base stations in an area which has been analysed before.

This tool will be devided in two parts: The actual tracker, which is an Android application (currently running on 2.3.3) and some piece of code which will be able to analyse the data provided.

Note: The project is in a pretty early stage and will therefore take some time to grow. 

I will release the tracker code in the near future.
